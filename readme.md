# Socket chat

### This is a chat app built on node.js and web sockets.


##### What and why?
I wanted to make a chat app, and found [this link]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHbCkikFfDE on the web. What I did was exactly as instructed in the video, and for now I've only made minor changes to the code to make it work.
More changes will come later.

##### How?
1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. cd into this app 
3. In your terminal, make sure you have node installed
4. Type **node server** in your terminal
5. Open your favourite browser, and go to [http://localhost:3000/]http://localhost:3000/

You can change port in the **package.json** file if you want to use another port.


**The texts are in norwegian, but there shouldn't be a problem to change that to your preferred language**
